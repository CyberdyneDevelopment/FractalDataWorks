// surface binds to a contract and the aggregation stays replaceable.

// TODO: derive this from your domain's factory contract. FDW does not use one universal name --
// SecretManagers, Connections and Notifications each declare their own, and several are generic in
// the service, factory and configuration types. Check the real signature in
// Fdw.Services.ServiceNamePlural before wiring the option below.
