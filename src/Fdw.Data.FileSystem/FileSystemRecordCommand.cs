/// (<see cref="FileSystemReadCommand"/> / <see cref="FileSystemWriteCommand"/>) is the I/O direction.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Why a native command at all: <c>ConnectionBase</c> routes <c>Execute(IDataCommand, IDataContainer)</c>
/// through a translator to a native command type (here <see cref="IFileSystemCommand"/>),
/// then runs <c>Execute&lt;T&gt;(nativeCommand, IStorageContainer)</c>. This is the same seam MsSql (SqlCommand)
/// and Http (HttpRequestMessage) use; the FileSystem native command is the file-I/O instruction carrying
/// the path the translator computed from the container's <see cref="IStorageContainer.Path"/>.
/// <para>
/// Why two subtypes rather than a direction flag: read and write are distinct operations with distinct
/// payloads (a write carries rows, a read does not), so the connection dispatches by pattern-matching the
/// command type — no enum/flag discriminator and no switch on a direction value.
