/// <summary>

/// <para>
/// <see cref="ResolveAuthSecret"/> is a delegate rather than an already-resolved string on purpose.
/// The login secret usually comes from another secret manager, whose read is asynchronous, while
/// <c>IServiceFactory.Create</c> is synchronous across every FDW domain. Resolving eagerly would mean
/// blocking on a task inside factory construction — a deadlock risk the VSTHRD002 analyzer refuses,
/// and rightly. Deferring it also means a workload assertion is read when it is used rather than when
/// the manager was built, which matters because those rotate.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Known gap, stated rather than papered over.</b> When <see cref="Engine"/> issues credentials
/// (Vault's database engine), Vault mints BOTH a username and a password, and this secret manager
/// returns the password as the secret value with the username in
/// <c>SecretValue.Metadata["username"]</c>. The connection layer today takes its username from the
/// connection's own configuration and reads only the password
/// (<c>SqlAuthConfiguration.BuildAuthFragment</c>), so a Vault role that rotates the username will not
/// connect until that layer consumes the metadata. Static-username Vault roles work today. That is a
/// gap in the connection mechanism, and the fix belongs there — routing a Vault-minted username
/// through a side channel at one call site is the symptom patch that leaves every other caller broken.
